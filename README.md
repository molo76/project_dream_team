Following this tutorial:
https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-crud-web-app-with-python-and-flask-part-one

A good introduction to Flask and SQLAlchemy, hoping to take this and extend it to other uses.

09/05/2017:
DB tables created through SQLAlchemy, Home blueprint finished.

08/05/2017:
Half way through part-one, have db installed, SQLAlchemy set up (not yet tested) and basic Flask config, serving a 'hello world' test page.
